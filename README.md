# mvc-test
This is a simple website that makes use of the MVC design pattern. It implements it as follows:
* **data** is a simple array containing objects that hold only a number and an is-highlighted-tag
* **view** renders the objects in the array and attaches them to a ul-node
* **controller** handles the information exchange between data and view, and implements the alter-highlight-function.

You can click the button at each list item to highlight it. All other items are then displayed normally (not being highlighted).
