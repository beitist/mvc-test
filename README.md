# MVC Design Pattern
The model-view-controller design pattern is frequently applied when designing GUIs. It allows larger teams to cooperate on development by structuring the code into three separate chunks.

## view
The view handles the view, including events etc.

## controller
The controller provides the logic behind the model and the view, that is: reacting to events, getting/ setting data, etc.
